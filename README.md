A Note About Reloading
----------------------

In versions of sopel up to 6.5.0 (the last tested version), reloading a third-party module
installed from pip, such as wolfram, results in duplicated output. This is `a known issue in
sopel <https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/issues/1056>`_ and is being worked on.

**Workaround:** After updating sopel-imdb through pip3, restart the bot at your earliest
convenience to enable the latest code.
